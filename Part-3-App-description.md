# App Description

## Objectives
In Part 3, you will learn:
- The difference between a layout and activity
- Details about the app you will build
- What a prototype is

## Layout vs. Activity
One of the most important first steps in building an app is defining its basic layout (what a user will see) and functionality (what a user can do). In this workshop, you will be creating an app with one layout containing two buttons, one labeled number and one labeled color, with a text field above them. This layout (two buttons and a text field) will correspond to a single user interface (called an Activity). In a multi-screen application, an Activity often corresponds to one singular screen. 

The Activity, not the layout, will give the buttons and the text field their behavior. The number button will generate a random number between 1 and 50 and the color button will generate a random color from the choices in a predetermined list. The text field will then display this generated number with the generated color as its font color.

## Mock-up
Many app designers use mock-up or prototyping software to create a preliminary draft of what their app will look like before they begin coding. Below is a prototype of the app you will create in this workshop, designed using proto.io.

TODO: Put a mock-up here.
