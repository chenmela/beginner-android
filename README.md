# Introduction

Welcome to the beginner installment of HackBU's Android tutorials! By the end of this workshop, you will have created your first Android app using Android Studio.

In Part 1 (Install Android Studio) and Part 2 (Create your first project), we will refer to sections of a Google codelab that already does a nice job of explaining how to install and set up Java and Android Studio. In both Part 1 and Part 2, we use the same headings as the Google codelab to provide additional information in each section to clarify minor details; however, our information is merely supplementary to the codelab, so be sure to refer to both HackBU and Google documentation.

Installation of Java and Android Studio can take a bit of time, so set aside 20-30 minutes to complete the steps in Parts 1 and 2.

# Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes some computer knowledge, including navigating the file system, downloading and opening files, and using the terminal (for Linux and Mac users only). You should also be familiar with programming in Java. Fundamental knowledge in another language (like C or Python) should also be sufficient. It may also be helpful to have basic understanding of a markup language like XML or HTML, but this is not strictly necessary.

If you're missing one or more of these prerequisites, chat with an organizer for further guidance.
